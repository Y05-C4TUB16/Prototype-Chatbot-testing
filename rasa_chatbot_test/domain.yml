#ONLINE EDUCATION QUESTIONS

#1. Homeschooling
  utter_homeschooling:
    - text: "Unlike homeschooling, where the parent is the primary teacher, HEDCen’s online program provides experienced and trained teachers to facilitate your child's learning. The program offers a structured daily routine and exposes students to a variety of challenging topics that foster critical thinking, creativity, logical reasoning, and a love for learning.
            Each child will be assigned a mentor, who serves as their personal Teacher-in-charge. 
            This mentor will communicate HEDCen values, recognize and nurture the child's unique intelligence, 
            provide feedback, and support their overall development throughout the academic year."

#2. Online Program
  utter_online-program:
    - text: "HEDCen’s online learning model aims to integrate best teaching practices while accommodating the unique needs of each learner. 
            The primary approach utilized will be Discovery-Based Learning.
            \n
            \nThis method employs engaging topics to connect knowledge, concepts, and skills, fostering curiosity and encouraging students to learn. Discovery topics encompass areas of interest such as Science, World Studies, History, Literature, Humanities, and the Arts.
             The thematic approach facilitates the integration of various subject areas related to the selected discovery topic for the week, serving as a foundation for deeper, practical, and immersive learning experiences.
            \n
            \nAside from this, a portion of the trimester shall also be devoted to learning concepts across the different subject areas that may not necessarily be encountered during discovery time."

#3. Experiential Learning
  utter_experiential-learning:
    - text: "Discovery-based learning allows for experiential learning while recognizing the limitations set by online education.  Teachers are not entirely prevented from conducting simulations online or facilitating simple experiments for the child to do at home.
     We shall continue to provide experience-based lessons as we see fit."
#4. Transferees
  utter_transferees:
    - text: "All students, both returning and new, are expected to undergo a period of adjustment as the school transitions to online learning for the first trimester. The school will provide guidelines for both parents and students to assist in establishing a new routine at home. 
    The mentor assigned to each student will monitor the child's adaptation to these changes and, in collaboration with the school administration, may offer appropriate recommendations to the student and/or their parents."
#5. Children Screen Time
  utter_children-screentime:
    - text: "This varies across the different grade levels.
            \n
            \nFor EED, Grades 2 and 3 - Lessons are to be 15 to 20 minutes per subject.  Cumulative class hours shall be from 2.5 to 3 hours per day. The remaining hours are allotted for individual work and self-learning.
            \n
            \nFor Grade 4 to 6 - Lessons are to be 30 minutes per subject.  Cumulative class hours are 4 to 4.5 hours per day.  The remaining hours are allotted for individual work and self-learning.
            \n
            \nFor JHS and  SHS -  Students in JHS and SHS are to have 45 minutes of screen time per subject, with about 5 to 6 subjects per day.  SHS may have double periods for a subject if it shall help facilitate the delivery of lessons in an efficient manner."

#6. Children with Special Needs
  utter_children-special:
    - text: "For children with special needs, enrollment may proceed if the school determines that the current online setup will be beneficial to the child."

#7. Online program Scale
  utter_online-learning-scale:
    - text: "Yes. For as long as students have access to the internet, they may be part of our online program wherever they may be. "

#8. Remotely Guidance and Counseling
  utter_guidance-counseling:
    - text: "Yes, this will be conducted by appointment, in accordance with the practices established by the school last year."

#9. Orientation for students and Parents
  utter_orientation:
    - text: "Yes, the school will provide an online orientation along with guidelines to assist parents and students in adapting to the online setup. 
    The orientation schedule will be announced at a later date on the school’s official Facebook page."

#10. Required specifications of the gadget needed in the Computer Science Class
  utter_computer-specs:
    - text: "A desktop or a laptop may be used for computer science classes.
    \n
    \nFor desktops:
    \n1. The processor should have a frequency of 2.5GHz and at least dual-core or quad-core.
    \n2. The RAM should at least be 4GB.
    \n3. There should be a  2GB or 4GB video card.

    \n
    \nComputers running on both Windows and Macintosh operating systems manufactured in 2015 and later versions should suffice.
      As for tablets and smartphones, though these may be useful in the general online classes, 
      the software used in our computer science subject is not usually compatible with the said devices."
